## Setup Python Environment

We recommend setting up a Conda virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure a consistent environment. If you haven't already, install Conda by following the instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/).

Once Conda is installed, create a new virtual environment using the provided `environment.yml` file. Run the following command:
   ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

The `environment.yml` file contains the necessary packages and dependencies for this project.
